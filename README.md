Run 100+ powerful applications on-demand, without buying extra hardware or replacing your OS. Yantra is to self-hosted apps what Homebrew is to software packages: simple, elegant, and built for your daily driver. If you like Umbrel but do not want an OS takeover, Yantra gives you the same app-store flow on the machine you already use.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Launch Yantra in seconds with a single Docker command and access it at http://localhost.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name yantra \
  -p 80:5252 \
  -p 443:5252 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/besoeasy/yantra
```

**✅ That’s it!** Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost to start deploying apps.

### Linux Server Setup (Ubuntu/Debian)

If you want a guided setup that installs Docker, configures permissions, opens ports 80/443, and runs Yantra:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/besoeasy/Yantra/main/i.sh | sudo bash
```

### System Requirements

- **Docker** installed and running
- **Linux, macOS, or Windows** (with Docker Desktop)
- **Disk space** for app data (minimal baseline, grows with apps)
- **Network access** to Docker daemon

## 🧭 Why Yantra

Most homelab platforms treat your hardware like an **OS replacement**. Yantra is different: it is a lightweight app store that runs **alongside** your existing system. Your laptop stays yours. Install once, run what you need, and shut it down when you are done.

### Built for daily machines

- **Replace OS-based platforms** without reinstalling your system.
- **Run locally on a laptop** for personal workflows, testing, or short-lived apps.
- **Keep full control** with standard Docker Compose and open volumes.

## 💾 Volume Management & WebDAV

Yantra gives you **direct access** to your data with built-in WebDAV support.

1. **Browse Volumes**: Go to the **Volumes** tab and click **Browse** on any volume.
2. **WebDAV Access**: The browser uses `dufs`, which inherently supports WebDAV.
3. **Sync Data**: Use WebDAV to sync files between volumes or machines.

**Example: Syncing two volumes with rclone**

```bash
# Sync from Volume A (port 5001) to Volume B (port 5002)
rclone sync :webdav:http://localhost:5001 :webdav:http://localhost:5002 --webdav-vendor other
```

## 💾 Volume Backup & Restore

Yantra makes it easy to backup and restore Docker volumes to S3-compatible storage (MinIO), perfect for migrating data or creating snapshots.

### Backup a Volume

1. Navigate to the **Volumes** tab in the Yantra UI
2. Click the **Backup** button next to any volume
3. The volume will be backed up as a `.tar.gz` archive to your configured S3/MinIO storage

### Restore a Volume

1. Go to the **Volumes** tab
2. Click the **Restore** button
3. Select your backup from the S3/MinIO storage
4. The volume will be recreated with all your data

**Use Cases:**
- 📦 Migrate data between machines
