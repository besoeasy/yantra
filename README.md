## ✨ Why Yantra?

### The Problem with Traditional Homelabs

Most homelab platforms (Umbrel, CasaOS, etc.) treat your hardware like an **operating system replacement**. They demand your **entire computer**, require dedicated hardware, and lock you into their ecosystem. This approach made sense for Raspberry Pis gathering dust in drawers, but it's overkill for modern users who want self-hosted tools without buying extra hardware.

### Yantra's Philosophy: An App Store, Not an OS

Yantra takes a fundamentally different approach. It's a **lightweight app store** that runs _alongside_ your existing operating system, not instead of it. Think of it like Homebrew or apt, but for self-hosted applications with beautiful UI.

Your laptop remains yours. Your OS stays untouched. Yantra just gives you one-click access to powerful self-hosted apps whenever you need them.

### Feature Comparison

| Feature            | 🔧 Yantra                      | 🚫 Others (Umbrel/CasaOS)              |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Philosophy**     | App Store (Runs _on_ your OS)  | Operating System (Taking over your OS) |
| **Hardware**       | Your existing Laptop/PC        | Dedicated Pi/Server                    |
| **Installation**   | Single Docker command          | Full OS installation required          |
| **Flexibility**    | Run alongside daily work       | Exclusive computer use                 |
| **Control**        | Full System Access             | Locked Ecosystem                       |
| **Resource Usage** | On-demand (start what you use) | Always-on services                     |
| **Isolation**      | Clean Docker Containers        | System-wide dependencies               |
| **Portability**    | Easy backup/migration          | Tied to specific hardware              |
| **Learning Curve** | Familiar Docker workflow       | New OS paradigm to learn               |

### Why This Matters

**🎯 Zero Commitment**: Install apps temporarily, test them out, delete them when done. No permanent system changes.

**💻 Use Your Daily Driver**: No need to keep a separate machine running 24/7. Spin up services on your work laptop when needed, shut them down when you're done.

**🔓 No Lock-In**: Built on standard Docker Compose. Every app configuration is transparent and portable. Don't like Yantra? Your apps will work anywhere Docker runs.

**⚡ Instant Utility**: Need to convert a file? Download a video? Edit a PDF? Launch the app, do your task, close it. Homelab tools become everyday utilities instead of weekend projects.

**The Result?** You get a powerful server-grade environment without sacrificing your daily driver machine, buying extra hardware, or committing to a new operating system.

## 💾 Volume Management & WebDAV

Yantra gives you **direct access** to your data with built-in WebDAV support.

1. **Browse Volumes**: Go to the **Volumes** tab and click **Browse** on any volume.
2. **WebDAV Access**: The browser uses `dufs`, which inherently supports WebDAV.
3. **Sync Data**: Use WebDAV to sync files between volumes or machines.

**Example: Syncing two volumes with `rclone`**

```bash
# Sync from Volume A (port 5001) to Volume B (port 5002)
rclone sync :webdav:http://localhost:5001 :webdav:http://localhost:5002 --webdav-vendor other
```
