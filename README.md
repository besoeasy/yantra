## Why Yantra?

We created Yantra as a **faster, lighter, and more transparent** alternative to Umbrel. Umbrel's heavy apps, forced proxy architecture, and slow update cycles made self-hosting unnecessarily painful. Yantra takes a different approach:

- **Direct access** - No forced reverse proxies slowing down your apps
- **Minimal footprint** - ~70MB RAM vs 500MB+ for alternatives
- **Fast deployments** - Deploy apps in seconds, not minutes
- **Open & transparent** - Simple codebase anyone can understand and modify
- **Docker-native** - Works with standard Docker Engine for reliable container management

## Supported Operating Systems

Yantra runs on any Debian-based Linux distribution:

- **Debian** 11, 12+
- **Ubuntu** 20.04, 22.04, 24.04+
- **Raspberry Pi OS** (Bullseye, Bookworm)
- **Linux Mint** 20, 21+
- **Pop!\_OS** 20.04+
- **Elementary OS** 6+
- **MX Linux** 21+
- Any other Debian derivative

## Features

- 🚀 One-click app deployment
- 📦 Container management with volume cleanup
- 🎨 Clean, dark-mode Vue.js interface
- 🏪 Built-in app store with 6+ popular self-hosted apps
- � Docker-based (reliable, boot-persistent)
- 💾 Minimal resource usage (~70MB RAM)
