I will provide a reference logo image. Create a NEW original logo mark inspired by the reference’s overall vibe (shape language, weight, rhythm), but do not copy it or trace it—no identical silhouettes or distinctive elements.

Design requirements:

1. Export as PNG, with transperent background.
2. No text, no letters, no numbers, no slogans.
3. Use a minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 flat colors (no gradients, no textures).
4. Clean vector style, high contrast, balanced negative space.

“Avoid: photorealism, 3D renders, drop shadows, bevels, glow, gradients, mockups, busy details, thin lines, clipart style, brand names, watermarks.”
