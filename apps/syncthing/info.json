  "description": "Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program that syncs files between two or more computers in real-time. It replaces proprietary cloud services with an open, decentralized, and private solution. Files are synced directly between your devices using peer-to-peer connections, meaning your data never touches any cloud server. Features include end-to-end encryption, version control, ignore patterns, bandwidth limits, NAT traversal, file versioning, and a beautiful web UI. It's cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, BSD) and works great for keeping photos, documents, and important files in sync across your devices.",
  "usecases": [
    "Sync your photos from your phone to your home server automatically when on WiFi.",
    "Keep important documents synchronized across your laptop, desktop, and server without using Dropbox or Google Drive.",
    "Create a private backup solution - sync to a secondary device for redundancy.",
    "Share files with family members using device-to-device synchronization."

    "Uses ports 22000 (TCP) and 21027 (UDP) for synchronization",
    "Works behind NAT with proper configuration",
    "No account or cloud required - all peer-to-peer"
