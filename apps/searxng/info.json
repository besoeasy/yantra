  "description": "SearXNG is a free and privacy-focused metasearch engine that can be self-hosted. It aggregates results from over 80 search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, etc.) while keeping your searches private - no tracking, no logging, no personalization. It strips tracking parameters from URLs, blocks ads in results, and gives you a clean interface. You can customize which engines to use, create themes, enable infinite scroll, and set default preferences. Perfect for privacy-conscious users who want the power of multiple search engines without being tracked.",

    "Search the web without being tracked - your search queries never leave your server.",
