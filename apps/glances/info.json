  "description": "Glances is a powerful cross-platform system monitoring tool that provides a comprehensive view of your server's performance. It displays real-time metrics including CPU usage (per core), memory consumption, disk I/O and space, network traffic, process list, Docker container stats, and hardware sensors (temperature, fan speed). Features include web UI for remote monitoring, alert thresholds, historical data, export to InfluxDB for graphing, and auto-discovery of Docker containers. It's like htop but accessible through a browser with more detailed information.",
  "usecases": [
    "Monitor server performance in real-time through the web interface.",
    "Track Docker container resource usage alongside host metrics.",
    "Set up alerts when CPU, memory, or disk exceeds thresholds.",
    "View historical data by exporting to time-series databases."
