  "description": "Whoogle is a self-hosted search proxy that fetches Google search results and presents them without ads, tracking, or clutter. It provides a clean, privacy-focused search experience while using Google's search algorithm. Features include no ads or tracking, customizable themes (dark, light, separator), config filters, language and region customization, HTML/DJSON/TXT export options, safe search toggle, and the ability to use as your default search engine. It's the simplest way to search Google privately - your searches never directly hit Google's servers from your IP.",
