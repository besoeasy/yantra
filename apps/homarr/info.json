  "description": "Homarr is a sleek, modern dashboard that puts all your self-hosted services in one beautiful interface. It features a drag-and-drop layout editor, over 30 built-in integrations for popular self-hosted apps (Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, Jellyfin, Portainer, and many more), and access to 10,000+ icons. The dashboard provides at-a-glance status information for your services, quick access links, and the ability to display system information like CPU, memory, and storage usage. It's designed to be your homelab's command center, showing everything running in your network at a glance.",
  "usecases": [
    "Create a unified homepage showing all your self-hosted apps with live status indicators.",
    "Monitor your homelab services at a glance - see which containers are running, down, or have issues.",
    "Display system metrics (CPU, RAM, disk) from your server directly on the dashboard.",
    "Use as your browser's start page for quick access to frequently used services and bookmarks."
