  "description": "Smokeping is a powerful network monitoring tool that measures latency and packet loss to your network targets over time. It sends ICMP pings and visualizes the data in detailed graphs showing min/max/average response times, standard deviation, and packet loss percentages. Features include multi-target monitoring, custom ping intervals, alerting on thresholds, historical data retention, and a clean web interface showing trends over hours, days, weeks, or months. Perfect for monitoring your internet connection quality, tracking latency to game servers, or monitoring network equipment.",
  "usecases": [
    "Monitor your home internet connection quality over time.",
    "Track latency to important servers (gaming, work VPNs).",
    "Get alerted when packet loss or latency exceeds thresholds.",
    "Prove internet issues to your ISP with historical data."
