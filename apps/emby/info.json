  "description": "Emby is a media server that organizes your video, music, and photo collections and streams them to devices. Similar to Plex, it offers a premium experience with features like theater mode for big screens, live TV with DVR capabilities, hardware transcoding, mobile sync for offline viewing, and a comprehensive guide. Emby offers both a free and paid (Emby Premiere) version - the Docker image includes all features but some require a paid subscription. It's a solid alternative to Jellyfin with a more polished interface but less customization.",
