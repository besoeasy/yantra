  "description": "Strfry is a high-performance relay for Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays), a decentralized social network protocol. Nostr uses simple JSON messages that get relayed between users through multiple relays - no central server required. Running your own Strfry relay gives you control over your piece of the network, supports the protocol, and can provide a more reliable connection for your clients. Features include ultra-fast LMDB storage for high throughput, WebSocket connections, NIP-01 basic protocol support, configurable event limits, and compression.",
  "usecases": [
    "Run your own nostr relay to support the decentralized network.",
    "Host a relay for friends or community with custom policies.",
    "Build your own piece of the nostr network.",
    "Use as a personal relay for your own notes."
