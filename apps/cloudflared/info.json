  "description": "Cloudflared (Cloudflare Tunnel) creates a secure connection between your server and Cloudflare's global network, allowing you to expose services to the internet without opening firewall ports. This means you can access your self-hosted apps from anywhere while keeping your server protected. Features include zero-trust access controls, authentication via Cloudflare Access, automatic TLS certificates, and support for multiple services through one tunnel. It's the easiest way to securely expose your homelab services to the internet without dealing with port forwarding or dynamic DNS.",
