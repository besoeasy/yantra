  "description": "Watchtower is a container update tool that automatically updates your Docker containers when new images are pushed to registries. It monitors running containers, checks for updated images, stops old containers, pulls new images, and starts fresh containers with the same parameters. Features include schedule-based updates (cron), cleanup of old images after update, notification support, update filtering (include/exclude specific containers), and graceful rolling updates. Perfect for keeping your homelab up to date without manually pulling and restarting every container.",
