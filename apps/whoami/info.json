  "description": "Whoami is an extremely simple HTTP service that prints all incoming request details back to the client. When you access it, it displays the hostname, IP address, headers, and other request information. It's primarily used for testing reverse proxies, load balancers, Kubernetes ingress, Docker networking, and other infrastructure. Features include displaying request method, path, headers, client IP, and server info in a clean format. Perfect for testing that your reverse proxy is working, checking what headers are being passed, or debugging network configurations.",
  "usecases": [
    "Test reverse proxy configurations.",
    "Verify what headers are being forwarded.",
    "Check your public IP as seen by the server.",
    "Debug Docker networking and port forwarding."
