  "description": "Portainer is a powerful, lightweight Docker management UI that simplifies container management through an intuitive web interface. It allows you to manage Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, and stacks without needing to use the command line. Features include container lifecycle management (start, stop, restart, remove), real-time container logs viewing and searching, container console access, resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory), image management (pull, push, build, tag), stack deployment with Docker Compose, webhook support for CI/CD integration, and environment management for multiple Docker hosts. With over 100 million installations, Portainer is the most popular Docker management tool.",
