  "description": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying, making it perfect for modern applications. Features include ACID compliance, MVCC for concurrent access, foreign keys, triggers, stored procedures, views, complex queries, JSONB for document storage, full-text search, GIS extensions (PostGIS), and an extensive ecosystem of extensions (pgvector for AI, timescaledb for time-series, citus for distributed). It's the database of choice for many production applications.",
  "usecases": [
    "Use as the database backend for complex applications like Wiki.js, Ghostfolio, or Home Assistant.",
    "Store JSON data alongside relational data in the same database.",
    "Enable full-text search for building search features in your applications.",
    "Use pgvector extension for storing and querying AI embeddings."
