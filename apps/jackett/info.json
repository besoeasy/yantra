  "short_description": "API bridge that provides torrent indexer functionality to PVR apps like Sonarr and Radarr.",
  "description": "Jackett works as a bridge between your PVR apps (Sonarr, Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato) and torrent trackers. It provides a unified API - your PVR sends one query to Jackett, and Jackett queries multiple torrent trackers on your behalf, returning standardized results. It supports over 500 public and private trackers, handles authentication, capsulates API differences, and provides Torznab support. Without Jackett, you'd need to configure each PVR app with each tracker's individual API - Jackett simplifies this to one integration.",
  "usecases": [
    "Enable automated media downloading by connecting Jackett to Sonarr/Radarr.",
    "Search for torrents across multiple trackers from one interface.",
    "Get fresh releases automatically downloaded to your media library.",
    "Use with multiple PVR apps (TV, movies, music) through one integration."
