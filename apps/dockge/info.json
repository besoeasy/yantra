It provides an interactive editor for writing docker-compose.yml files with syntax highlighting, a visual interface for managing services (start, stop, restart, logs), stack management, and easy interaction with the compose.yaml format. Features include compose.yaml editor with autocomplete, one-click stack deployment, service management (logs, shell, restart), and a clean modern interface. Perfect for those who prefer Docker Compose but want a visual tool.",
