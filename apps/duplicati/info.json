  "description": "Duplicati is a free, open-source backup client that stores encrypted, incremental backups to cloud storage services or local drives. It works with a wide range of protocols including SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, and cloud providers. Features include AES-256 encryption, source-code deduplication to reduce storage, backup scheduling, retention policies, version history, email notifications, and a powerful web interface. Perfect for setting up automated backups of your server data to local NAS, remote servers, or cloud storage - all with strong encryption so even the backup location can't read your data.",
