  "description": "Monero Node is a pruned full node for Monero that provides RPC interface for wallets and supports the Monero network. It uses less disk space than a full node while still providing full verification. Features include pruned mode for reduced storage, restricted RPC mode for security (prevents spending), P2P network connectivity for blockchain sync, and automatic updates. Perfect for connecting your Monero wallet (GUI, CLI, or mobile) to your own node instead of relying on public nodes - improving privacy by not leaking your addresses to third parties.",
  "usecases": [
    "Connect your Monero wallet to your own node for better privacy.",
    "Support the Monero network by relaying transactions.",
    "Build applications that interact with the Monero blockchain.",
    "Avoid using public RPC nodes that could deanonymize you."
