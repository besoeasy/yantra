  "description": "Uptime Kuma is a fancy self-hosted monitoring tool that helps you monitor your services and get notified when they go down. It supports HTTP(s), TCP, Ping, DNS, Push, Steam Game Server, and more than 30 other protocol types. Features include beautiful status pages with uptime history, multi-region monitoring, certificate expiration tracking, docker container monitoring via socket, push notifications (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Email, SMS via Twilio), and a 100% open-source design. It's a modern alternative to tools like Uptime Robot or Statuspage.io that you fully own.",
