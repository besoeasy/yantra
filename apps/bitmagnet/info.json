    "Bitmagnet bundles its own PostgreSQL instance — no separate database setup is required.",
    "The Web UI runs on port 3333 but is not published to the host by default. Access it via a reverse proxy or change the port mapping in compose.yml.",
    "DHT crawling uses port 3334 (TCP + UDP). Ensure this port is open on your firewall for effective peer discovery.",
    "The default PostgreSQL password is `postgresx`. Change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable in compose.yml before deploying in a production environment."
