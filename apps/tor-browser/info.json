  "description": "Tor Browser in Docker allows you to browse the web anonymously through the Tor network without installing it locally on your machine. It provides a complete Tor Browser experience accessible through any browser via VNC. This is useful for running in a headless environment, providing anonymous browsing on systems without a display, or isolating Tor usage from your main system. Features include connection to the Tor network, protection against tracking and fingerprinting, access to .onion sites, and no locally stored data after container restart.",
  "usecases": [
    "Browse the internet anonymously from any location.",
    "Access .onion sites without installing Tor Browser locally.",
    "Isolate Tor usage from your main system for security.",
    "Use as a privacy-focused browsing solution on headless servers."
