  "description": "Prowlarr is an indexer manager that supports both Usenet and BitTorrent trackers. It acts as a central hub connecting your PVR apps (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Sailarr) to both Usenet indexers and BitTorrent trackers through a unified API. Unlike Jackett which only supports BitTorrent, Prowlarr handles both protocols. Features include support for 80+ Usenet indexers, BitTorrent tracker integration via Torznab/Cardigann, indexer health monitoring, RSS sync, seeding requirements per indexer, and authentication handling. It's the successor to both NZBHydra2 and Jackett.",
